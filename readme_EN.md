# Free Camera Instructions

- Set `enable` under `baseFreeCamera` in `scsp-config.json` to `true`.
- Scope of application: All 3D scenes. Including but not limited to homepage, story, Live.
> An unknown bug exists; this option will be disabled automatically when MV starts, but it can be re-enabled without affecting its feature.



## Free Camera Operation Method

- Movement: `W`, `S`, `A`, `D`
- Ascend: `Space`, Descend: `Ctrl`
- Reset camera: `R`

- Camera Rotation: 
  - Keyboard: `↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`
  - Mouse: 
    - Press the ` key (located to the left of the number keys, above the TAB key)
    - Or **hold down** the right mouse button
- Adjust Field of View (FOV)
  - Keyboard: `Q`, `E`
  - Or mouse scroll wheel



# Live MV Instructions

- When `Save & Replace costume changes` is checked, all costume changes will be recorded, locked costumes can also be recorded by clicking the Try-On button in the game, or casual costumes can be selected in the DressOrder interface, and all the changes will be applied automatically when MV starts; unwanted records can be removed using the `Remove` button in the "Saved Costume Data" sub-window to cancel them.
- When `Save & Replace costume changes` is checked and `Override MV unit idols` is checked, the last costume data can be saved by clicking the `Slot X` buttons in the "Override MvUnit Idols" sub-window; different slots can be used to record the same idol to achieve multiple appearances of the same idol with different costumes, and unrecorded slots will inherit the original data of the idols in the selected live unit.



# How to Localize

- After localizing the Json files in the dumps directory, place them in the `scsp_localify` directory.
- Localization Repository (Chinese): [SCSPTranslationData](https://github.com/ShinyGroup/SCSPTranslationData) Contributors are welcome to contribute their translations~



## Dump Original Text Yourself
- The UI text in the game can be roughly divided into three categories.

  - 1. Loaded through the game's `Localify` interface
  - 2. Loaded without using the `Localify` interface
  - 3. Loaded directly through Json (this part includes not only text but also other things like camera data, character actions, etc., which can be replaced by the plugin.)

  

- The first category corresponds to `localify.json`

- The second category corresponds to `local2.json` and `lyrics.json`

- Files other than these correspond to the third category

- (Some UI text goes through `Localify`, some don't, it's strange.)



### Story and Some UI Text Dump
After logging into the game, go to the story reading interface, press `ctrl` + `u`, a control window will pop up, check `Waiting Extract Text`, then click on any story title, and the story text and `localify.json` will be automatically dumped.



### Lyrics and Another Part of UI Text Dump
Set `dumpUntransLyrics` and `dumpUntransLocal2` in `scsp-config.json` to `true`, then open the game. The plugin will continuously dump untranslated parts into Json in real time.
